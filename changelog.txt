There are some major updates this time, please take your time to read before you update

- Constructor added
    - Constructor requires oil, battery and blocks and it will build those blocks for you
    - Logic is: Try to add 1 block forward and down, move forward if possible (block below needed)
    if adding a block or moving failed: rotate

- All liquid containers have been translated to mB (instead of full buckets)
- Liquid container was reduced to 5 buckets from 20 (now 5000mB)
- IMPORTANT: Because of ^ you will pretty much lose all liquid located in liquid containers and liquid storage containers, sorry.
- Creative: sneaking + right clicking with a chargeable item will now charge it in 10% increments
- Ore colors were changed to be more noticeable from each other
- Pipes now collide (meaning you won't pass through them anymore)
- Electric wire texture fixed
- Fuser now has 9 slots!
- Added bronze (crafted by fusing 1 copper and 3 tin ingots)
- Copper tools and armors have been removed (you will need to confirm this after you update)
- Added bronze tools and armors
- Added rubber
- Added copper ring
- Added wheel
- Liquid storage containers now keep their contents when harvested
- Liquid storage containers now show content when looked at
- Add gear

- Liquid related stuff recipes changed to use bronze instead of iron
- !!! updated most machine textures !!! thanks to Itamar
